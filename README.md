# HML_Production_Delay_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the idle times of HML machines during production shifts using SQL and Power BI. The goal is to identify inefficiencies, understand root causes of idleness (like material delays, operator absence, or machine downtime), and provide actionable insights to improve productivity.
