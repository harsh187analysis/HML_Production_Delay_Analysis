# Time Study Based HML Production Delay Analysis  
**Internship Project at Versatile Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.**

---

## Overview

This project was completed as part of my internship at **Versatile Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.**  
The goal was to conduct a time study analysis on HML (Heat Melt Lamination) machine operations to identify and reduce production delays due to machine idleness.

Using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, I extracted insights, visualized delay patterns, and recommended actionable solutions that led to a measurable improvement in operational efficiency.

---

## Objective

- Analyze machine idle time and classify reasons for delay  
- Improve shop floor productivity by reducing non-productive time  
- Develop a data-driven dashboard for real-time monitoring and decision-making  

---

## Tools Used

- **SQL** – For data querying, filtering, and preparation  
- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  
- **Excel** – For manual data entry and initial time tracking  

---

## Key Insights

- Frequent **roll loading delays** were a major cause of idle time  
- **Operator unavailability** and **material readiness issues** further increased downtime  
- **Layout inefficiencies** contributed to unnecessary movement and setup time  

---

## Actions Taken

- Recommended **pre-shift staging of materials and rolls**  
- Suggested assigning a **dedicated helper/operator** for roll changes  
- Proposed **workspace reorganization** to reduce walking distance and idle handling time  

---

## Results

- **Idle time reduced by approximately 37%**, resulting in smoother production flow  
- **Average machine efficiency increased from 60% to 73%**  
- **Real-time dashboards** helped shift supervisors identify and address issues quickly

## Learning & Impact

This project helped me build and apply key skills in:

- Process improvement through time studies  
- Business problem-solving with data  
- Data modeling, querying (SQL), and dashboarding (Power BI)  
- Communicating insights to operations teams for real-world implementation  

---

## Conclusion

This time study project is a strong example of how data can directly improve manufacturing efficiency.  
It reflects my hands-on experience in identifying operational bottlenecks and driving performance improvements through data-driven decisions.

I look forward to applying the same structured, results-oriented approach in future roles as a **Business Analyst** or **Data Analyst**.
